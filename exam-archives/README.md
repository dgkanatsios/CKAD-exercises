Request Developers to contribute questions with higher weightage from their experience of CKAD examination and segregate them accordingly and please make sure while contributing that a similar model question is not already present....... keep Kubectling...!!

the reason for this request is because the lower weightage questions are mostly covered in the exercises, the aspirants will be benefitted if they can find a few elaborate questions which require usto perform a combination of exercises and require greater attention span.
